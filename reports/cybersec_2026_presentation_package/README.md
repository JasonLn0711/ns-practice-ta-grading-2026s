# CYBERSEC 2026 Presentation Package

Canonical package for the CYBERSEC 2026 talk:

`AI 軟體醫材的資安實戰：從美國 FDA 524B 規範到 Threat Modeling 與 Patch SLA 的完整落地`

This package is intentionally compact. Earlier working drafts separated strategy, 23-slide blueprint, visual production, scripts, compact plan, and rehearsal notes. Those overlapping files have been merged into this smaller working set so the speaker, slide editor, and evaluator all use the same source of truth.

## Canonical Files

| File | Use It For | Primary Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Package routing, boundaries, and source anchors | Fast orientation |
| `01_strategy_and_rubric_alignment.md` | Talk positioning, audience promise, narrative, timing, visual strategy, rubric translation | Design decisions |
| `02_compact_14_slide_deck_spec.md` | Build-ready slide plan for the recommended compact deck | Exact slide production spec |
| `03_speaker_script_and_stage_rhythm.md` | Taiwan Traditional Chinese delivery script, rhythm map, cue cards, stage behavior | Rehearsal script |
| `04_scoring_rubric.md` | Strict 100-point evaluator framework and scoring sheet | Evaluation form |
| `05_rehearsal_and_iteration_runbook.md` | Review passes, dry runs, fix-order by score band, final readiness | Iteration system |

## Working Order

1. Lock the audience promise and timing with `01_strategy_and_rubric_alignment.md`.
2. Build or revise the deck from `02_compact_14_slide_deck_spec.md`.
3. Rehearse from `03_speaker_script_and_stage_rhythm.md`.
4. Score each run with `04_scoring_rubric.md`.
5. Apply the next repair pass from `05_rehearsal_and_iteration_runbook.md`.

Do not re-expand the package into separate strategy, visual, script, compact, and full-deck variants unless there is a real delivery need. The recommended delivery surface is the `14`-slide compact version.

## Design Contract

| Constraint | Package Rule | Rubric Protected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Serious conference tone | Use product-risk, evidence-chain, and operating-decision language | Content Depth and Value, Stage Presence |
| No classroom report posture | Every slide must answer a decision question: what risk, what evidence, what action | Delivery Quality, Audience Impact |
| No decorative security imagery | Visuals must show architecture, evidence, workflow, comparison, or decision | Visual Design of Slides |
| No slide bloat | One dominant message per slide; secondary detail belongs in speaker notes or Q&A | Structure and Narrative Design, Stage Rhythm and Time Control |
| No public sensitive content | Exclude proprietary code, private hospital/client detail, student records, raw submissions, exploit recipes, and patent-sensitive implementation mechanics | Stage Presence, Content Depth and Value |

## Consolidation Decision

The working package now treats the `14`-slide version as canonical. The earlier `23`-slide structure remains useful as historical context in Git history and in the planning repo source files, but it is no longer the active build target. The consolidation removes duplicate timing plans, duplicate slide explanations, duplicate stage scripts, and repeated scoring text.

## Current Delivery Promise

The talk should leave the audience with one operating model:

`AI SaMD security is not a model-security checklist. It is a product trust system: scope the product, trace the evidence, test the exposure, govern findings, and prove repairability.`

Stage-language anchors:

- `你賣的不是模型`
- `法規要的是證據，不是口號`
- `Cyber Safety is Patient Safety`
- `沒有 decision，就沒有治理；沒有證據，就沒有信任`
- `先把安全做進產品，法規文件才會自然長出來`
