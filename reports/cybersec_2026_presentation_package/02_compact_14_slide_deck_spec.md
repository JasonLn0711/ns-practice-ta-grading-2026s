# 02 Compact 14-Slide Deck Spec

Purpose: build the recommended compact `14`-slide CYBERSEC deck. This file merges the earlier slide blueprint, compact plan, detailed execution spec, and visual production notes into one build-ready document.

## 1. Production Rules

| Rule | Required Build Behavior | Rubric Protected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Slide title is a claim | Prefer `Risk grows with architecture` over `Product Scales`. | Structure and Narrative Design |
| One visual object | Each slide has one phrase, ladder, evidence chain, stack, comparison, flow, or roadmap. | Visual Design |
| Labels beat paragraphs | Diagram labels may be technical; paragraphs belong in speaker notes. | Stage Rhythm and Time Control |
| No sensitive examples | No proprietary code, private architecture, private hospital/client detail, raw submission, student record, exploit recipe, or patent-sensitive mechanism. | Stage Presence |
| Build for projection | Large type, high contrast, and enough empty space for a conference room. | Visual Design |
| Preserve five memory anchors | Slides 3, 5, 10, 12, and 14 are the audience's mental anchors. | Audience Impact |

## 5. Visual QA Before Export

- [ ] Slides 3, 5, 10, 12, and 14 are visually distinctive.
- [ ] Slide 6 uses an evidence chain, not a legal text block.
- [ ] Slide 7 has three balanced columns and does not become a control catalog.
- [ ] Slides 8-9 use matching comparison structure so product-scale growth is obvious.
- [ ] Slide 12 makes `Decision` the dominant node.
- [ ] No slide contains private architecture, proprietary code, exploit detail, private hospital/client detail, student data, or patent-sensitive implementation mechanics.
- [ ] Every slide can be understood at headline level within three seconds.
